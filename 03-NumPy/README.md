# NumPy

Numeric Python Library

## History

2005 based on Numeric python library, open source & freeware, developed using C and Python

## Install

pip install numpy

## Need

- Statistics operation
- Linear algebraic operation
- Differential calculus operation
- Integral calculus operation

Operation on Millions of records/list or tuples

math library is for basic operation.

## Data structure

- nd array(main ds under numpy) instead of list
- backbone for other library: pandas, scikit-learn etc

### Difference between list and nd array

- index based, sequential, indexing, slicing allowed
- list is heterogeneous, where nd array ==> nd array
- list is memory heavy, nd array is memory optimized
- vectorization features
